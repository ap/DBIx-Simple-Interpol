=head1 NAME

DBIx::Simple::Interpol - monkey-patch DBIx::Simple to use SQL::Interpol

=head1 VERSION

version 1.005

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DBIx::Simple::Interpol;
  # ...
  my $rows = $db->iquery( '
      SELECT title
      FROM threads
      WHERE date >', \$x, '
      AND subject IN', \@subjects, '
  ' )->arrays;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The recommended way to use L<SQL::Interpol> is via its L<DBIx::Simple>
integration, which provides an excellent alternative to plain DBI access.

Ordinarily, the C<iquery> method in L<DBIx::Simple> integrates L<SQL::Interp>.
But by loading this module instead (or after) L<DBIx::Simple>, the C<iquery>
method will be patched to use L<SQL::Interpol> instead.

This is all there is to this module.
